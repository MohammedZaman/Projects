Introduction

I have been developing a program that allows users to check the
play count and rating of a video entry. Additionally, the user is able to create a list of videos
which they can play and the play count is incremented based on the videos in the list. Also, the
user can change the rating of each video. This is all done within a single Graphical user interface
using multiple classes to separate the code and making it more readable. I have also implemented
a great deal of validation to minimise the bad user inputs and crashes.
