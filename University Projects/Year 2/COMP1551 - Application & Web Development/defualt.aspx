    <p style="padding:10%; font-family:Calibri; font-size:18px;">Friends with paws Welfare Trust is an animal rehoming charity with their main
site based on the outskirts of London in the UK. For the moment the organization is
managing pets’ sanctuaries in 3 countries UK, Romania and Germany.
As well as the young and healthy, their countryside sanctuaries always have a
collection of much loved resident pets that are unlikely to be adopted, such as the
elderly and long-term sick. Sanctuary animals include dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters
etc. as well as a few hand reared sheep, goats and a potbellied pig.
Responsible pet ownership is actively encouraged and, when funds allow it, they
send experienced Welfare Officers into deprived areas. Here, they help owners
understand their pet's needs and promote their spay and neuter scheme, which will
have prevented thousands of unwanted litters over the years.</p>
