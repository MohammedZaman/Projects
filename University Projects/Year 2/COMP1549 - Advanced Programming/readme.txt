Senario 

"You are working for a software company that wants to improve its ability to design software that it is easy to
maintain and easy to extend. They are also interested in the concept of "reuse". In order to explore and illustrate
these concepts, they want you to do some work on a simple drawing app (called "Simple Draw") that was previously
developed by one of their junior programmers. In particular they want you to demonstrate: good object-oriented
design, design patterns, component creation, and use of threads."
